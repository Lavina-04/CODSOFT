# UI/UX Design Projects

This repository includes three user-centered UI/UX design projects created using Figma. Each design focuses on functionality, clarity, and modern aesthetics.

## 1. Online Plant Store  
An e-commerce interface for a plant shop featuring a clean homepage, product listing, and detailed product view. The layout emphasizes visuals, easy navigation, and a seamless shopping experience.

## 2. Restaurant Menu  
A digital restaurant menu designed for tablets or web. It uses a clean grid to display food items, pricing, and descriptions with intuitive filtering options to enhance user experience.

## 3. Mobile Login Flow  
A minimal, user-friendly mobile login and signup interface. The flow ensures accessibility and security, with simple input screens, error handling, and clear visual cues.
